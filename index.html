                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Pau Lujan and I'm a software developer based in Barcelona, Spain. I started my journey with computers at an early age with my first laptop at high school. At the age of 16 I enroled on an IT Technic course which I graduated from in 2016. Then I started another degree about Software Development that I finished but I didn't graduate because I got stuck with some subjects. For 3 years I worked full time away from computers but I always knew I would come back to this path whenever I had my life set up. It's now been 6 months since I started back again my studies and with all the experience I got from the first time I decided to take a different approach. I'm currently studying a Frontend Engineer course on Codecademy, dedicating all my free time to become the best software developer that I can be. After this, I'm already planning on taking the Backend course aswell and master my skills on some personal projects and courses to become a Full Stack Developer.</p>
