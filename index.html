                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Pau Lujan and I'm a software developer based in Barcelona, Spain. I started my journey with computers at an early age with my first laptop on high school, before that I only had small experiences with my mother's computer and the one in my local public library. At the age of 16 I started a course of IT Technic which I graduated from in 2016. Then I started another degree on Software Development that I finished but didn't graduate because I got stuck with some subjects. In that time I went through very difficult times in my life and I had to take some decissions and start working full time due to covid. I always knew I would come back to this world whenever I had my life set up. It's now been 6 months since I retook my studies and with all the experience I got from the first time I decided to take a different approach. I'm currently studying a Frontend Engineer course on Codecademy, dedicating all my free time to become the best software developer that I can be. After this, I'm already planning on taking the Backend course aswell and master my skills on other projects and courses to become a Full Stack Developer.</p>
